            <ul class="job-description">
              <li>
                Worked with a team of 6 to rewrite an existing data pipeline
                to process 250 million emails, decreasing the average processing
                time from 7 hours to 10 minutes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Designed and implemented the cloud infrastructure to support
                the new data pipeline. This took advantage of serverless
                computing to parallelize the processing time and to scale
                proportionally to the size of the data that was being processed.

              Senior Backend Engineer | Oct 2021 - June 2022

            <ul class="job-description">
              <li>
                Led the integration of an in-house endpoint authorization system
                across all endpoints. This substantially increased our
                application's security posture, as it tightened user access on
                existing resources and severely reduced the complexity of adding
                resources for an ever-evolving product, while only adding a
                ~5ms latency increase.
              </li>
              <li>
                Worked directly with the engineering team to define the
                "North Star" of our infrastructure. This included a detailed
                plan of our current state, our ideal state, and a roadmap to
                bridge the two.

              <li>
                Led automation of opening orders with our Title processing
                software, Qualia. This integration reduced the required manual
                hand-off effort between the Transaction Coordinators and
                Title Operations team from 15 minutes to under 1 minute per
                transaction.
              </li>
              <li>
                Architected a bidirectional ETL for integrating Salesforce as
                the de facto tool for internal stakeholders. This greatly
                increased the speed at which the stakeholders could iterate and
                improve their processes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Led various knowledge-sharing initiatives such as creating a
                series of hands-on tech talks, enacting an architecture overview
                for all new engineering hires, and mentoring new members during 
                onboarding.

              <li>
                Developed premiere features that helped revolutionize independent
                publishing, such as the ability to generate fully styled
                manuscripts and covers for both ebook and physical printing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Refined the conversion process from a legacy ETL system to a
                modern ETL system. Using a distributed task queue to run
                concurrent conversions, I reduced the total processing time
                from 25 hours to under 3 hours.
