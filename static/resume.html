            <ul class="job-description">
              <li>
                Managed a team of 3 to develop a data release system. This streamlined essential
                internal processes by reducing human error and enabled internal stakeholders to
                operate independently.
              </li>
              <li>
                Designed and built an API that served panelist-level subscription data. This API
                unlocked new revenue streams from customers, generating $400k within the first
                quarter of its launch.
              </li>
              <li>
                Worked with a team of 6 to re-design a high-performance data pipeline capable of
                processing 3+ billion emails in under 25 minutes This enabled us to deliver a market-
                level subscription analytics platform trusted by industry leaders such as Google,
                Apple, Disney, and Netflix.
              </li>
              <li>
                Architected a new data storage strategy, reducing cloud costs by 80% while
                achieving up to 12x faster query performance.

            <ul class="job-description">
              <li>
                Led the integration of an in-house endpoint authorization system across all endpoints.
                This substantially increased our application's security posture, as it tightened user access
                on existing resources and severely reduced the complexity of adding resources for an
                ever-evolving product, while only adding a ~5ms latency increase.
              </li>
              <li>
                Worked directly with the engineering team to define the "North Star" of our
                infrastructure. This included a detailed plan of our current state, our ideal state, and a
                roadmap to bridge the two.

            <ul class="job-description">
              <li>
                Led automation of opening orders with our Title processing software, Qualia. This
                integration reduced the required manual hand-off effort between the Transaction
                Coordinators and Title Operations team from 15 minutes to under 1 minute per
                transaction.
              </li>
              <li>
                Architected a bidirectional ETL for integrating Salesforce as the de facto tool for
                internal stakeholders. This enabled faster stakeholder iteration, improving their overall
                processes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Led various knowledge-sharing initiatives such as creating a
                series of hands-on tech talks, enacting an architecture overview
                for all new engineering hires, and mentoring new members during 
                onboarding.

                Refined the conversion process from a legacy ETL system to a modern ETL system. Using
                a distributed task queue to run concurrent conversions, I reduced the total processing
                time from 25 hours to under 3 hours.
